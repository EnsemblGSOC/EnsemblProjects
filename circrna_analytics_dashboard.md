# Circular RNA analytics frontend

## Brief Explanation

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an established class of highly stable non-coding RNAs, produced by a back-splice mechanism and have been identified in various cell lines and tissues across multiple species. Dynamic and divergent expression of circRNAs relative to other linear transcripts are associated with various biological processes and are potentially useful in delineating their functional relevance or as disease markers.

At Ensembl, we have developed workflows for accurate computational identification and quantification of circRNAs from high throughput RNAseq data. To facilitate circRNA research, this project will produce a responsive web-based analytics dashboard, integrated to an in-house catalogue of circRNAs identified from multiple species.

## Expected results

Design and development of a web application with functionalities for:
 - assessing distribution and abundance of circRNAs
 - circRNA isoform comparisons across samples
 - search feature, based on genome coordinates and host gene names
 - visual representation of inferred circRNA structure
 - link to Ensembl genome browser

## Required knowledge
 - Python/JavaScript
 - NodeJS or (any modern web development framework)
 - MySQL or NoSQL

## Difficulty
 - Medium

## Mentors
Osagie Izuogu, Fergal Martin

## Additional comments
 - All data / metrics to be presented in the dashboard will be provided
 - Preferred backend: MySQL
 - Knowledge of circRNAs not crucial
